# Ironhack starter kit recommendator

This project aims to provide a solution to the acquisition of material to attend a remote bootcamp in Ironhack, including both new and refurbished products whose market is booming.

By Web Scrapping trough Amazon, MediaMarkt and Segundamano.es the products referring to laptops and screens of any size, price and quality have been selected. 

With this information, a user interface is created where prices and qualities by brand can be researched. It also gives the option of having a recommendation on the best option for either brand new or refurbished products. To give a better recommendation, products were classified with a ratio price/RAM for laptops and price/inches of screen for screens.

With much room for improvement optimizing the user experience or adding new products or ratio qualities, it is a very useful tool for new and excited students, as we were not so many months ago!
